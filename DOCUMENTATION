NAME
       shimmer - Program to call somatic single base changes and copy number alterations from matched tumor and normal next generation sequences.

SYNOPSIS
       shimmer.pl <normal_sample_bam_file> <tumor_sample_bam_file> --ref <reference_fasta_file>

DESCRIPTION
       This script uses samtools to process two BAM formatted files (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) and call differences between the two files across a specified region.

INPUT
       The first argument to shimmer is the path of a fasta-formatted file for the reference sequence.  This fasta file must have a corresponding samtools index file with the same name except for an appended
       ".fai".

       The first and second arguments to shimmer are the paths of two BAM-formatted file of aligned sequencing reads.  These files must be sorted and indexed using samtools prior to running shimmer.

OUTPUT
OPTIONS
       --region chr
       --region chr:start-end
            This option specifies a region as a reference entry optionally followed by a position range, and causes variants to be called only in that region.

       --ref reference_fasta_file
            This option specifies the reference file to which the reads in the BAM files were aligned.  It is a required option.

       --minqual minimum_base_quality_score
            This option specifies a minimum phred quality score that can be required for read bases to be included in the counts for the Fisher's exact tests.

       --max_q maximum_acceptable_false_discovery_rate
            This option specifies the maximum FDR level to be set for the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for somatic SNV calling.
