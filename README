Shimmer

Shimmer is a program designed to identify somatic changes when run on two BAM files, 
one from normal tissue and the other from a tumor sample.  It uses Fisher's exact test 
along with multiple testing correction (Benjamini-Hochberg) to find significant 
differences between allele composition with a specified false discovery rate.

Shimmer was written by Nancy Fisher Hansen, a staff scientist in the Genome Technology 
Branch (GTB) of NHGRI, an institute at the National Institutes of Health.  Nancy can be
